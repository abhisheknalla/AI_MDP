MDP

For a model of Markov Decision Process, Policy creation via two methods : Value Iteration and Linear Programming

Model Description

Model world has 4*4 block grid, one positive terminal state, one negative terminal state. ![Here](https://github.com/abhisheknalla/AI_MDP/blob/master/Problem.pdf) is total description of the world.

Value Iteration

    value_iter.py contains the code which runs value iteration algorithm to find the utilities of all states and then final policy. It prints the result of every iteration.
